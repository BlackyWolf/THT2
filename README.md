## About this Fork

The original intention was to remake the tool using PHP and the Laravel framework. I was one of the people who said I'd help with it but between graduating college, getting a job and having the company close, and then relocating to a different state and adjusting to a new job I have not contributed to this project like I said I would. This will probably not be merged back into the original repository because it is taking a different direction than what was originally intended. If you'd like to work on the original repo you can find it [here](https://github.com/TheHostingTool/THT2).

This fork of The Hosting Tool 2 will remain open source but use ReactJS as the Front-End (might switch to VueJS when version 3.0 comes out) with ASP.NET Core Web API as the backend.

I will work on this when I have time.

## Supported Browsers

This project will only work in evergreen browsers. I am not supporting Internet Explorer under any circumstances. It's not worth it, and not only does it prevent me from developing software properly it brings no value to my clients and allows them to continue to use outdated products.

Some features I'll be using include CSS grids, so this may not work in all browsers right now.
