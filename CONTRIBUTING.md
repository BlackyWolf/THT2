## Etiquette

Before starting any work you might want to read these two articles: [Open Source Contribution Etiquette](https://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html) by Miguel de Icaza and [Don't "Push" Your Pull Requests](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) by Ilya Grigorik.

## Code Style

Follow the code style and do not deviate from it. If you think it needs to be changed or can be improved, open a discussion about it first. Frankly, the style itself doesn't matter; readability is what matters most. We have chosena style we believe will allow the project to be maintained for **years and/or decades** to come.

### All Languages

- One class per file.
- If a class is overloaded with generics, place **.generic.** after the class name and before the file extension type. e.g. Class.generic.js
- All file names for classes will follow Pascal Case, e.g. ThisClass.js
- One interface per file
- If an interface is overloaded with generics, place **.generic.** after the class name and before the file extension type. e.g. Class.generic.cs
- All file names for interfaces will follow Pascal Case, e.g. ThisInterface.cs
- Please do not overuse overloading classes and interfaces with generics.
- Make all names meaningful
- **All names should be spelled out and should not be abbreviated. If you think it should be abbreviated, please explain in detail why. Abbreviations impair readability**
